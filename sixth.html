  <p><h3>Turtle Hatchery was started by the Sri Lankans with a view to protect the turtles from extinction. Earlier, people usually fishermen used to collect the turtleâ€™s eggs and sold it to whoever would pay the higher price. With the commencement of the Turtle Hatchery these eggs were fed and cared for until they were 2 to 4 years old. You can find different species of turtles such as Green Turtle, Leatherback and Olive Ridley. Despite their extinction turtles are still...</h3></p>

        <p><h2>Overview</h2></p>
        <p><h3>The Turtle Care Centre at Kosgoda beach is one of 18 turtle hatcheries along the southern coast of Sri Lanka. The centre is located in the South Western coastal village of Kosgoda and was establised in 1981. It is also very popular as all five species of turtles that visit Sri Lanka nest in Benthota. This is not so with many of the other hatcheries around the island whose beaches host only some of the species.</h3></p>
