            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>The sea turtle hatchery is a nice place to visit if you’re in Hikkaduwa. The turtles are an amazing sight and it’s a special treat if you’re an animal lover. Fun fact: it’s a family-run conservation hatchery. It was first set up by a man named Ariyapala, and passed down to his daughter who tragically lost her life in the tsunami of 2004, after which Ariyapala’s son took over and rebuilt the hatchery with foreign aid.</p>
